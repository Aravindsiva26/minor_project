2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

# Install virtualenv if not installed
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment
virtualenv diabetes-env

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows
.\diabetes-env\Scripts\activate
# For Mac/Linux
source diabetes-env/bin/activate


3. Install Required Python Libraries

The project requires several Python packages, most of which are related to data processing, visualization, and machine learning. You can install them using pip.

Here’s a list of the required modules and their installation commands:

	•	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
	•	Numpy: For numerical computations.
	•	Matplotlib and Seaborn: For plotting and visualization.
	•	Scikit-learn: For machine learning models, evaluation metrics, and data preprocessing.
	•	Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
	•	LIME: For explainable AI.
	•	Pickle: For saving and loading models.

You can install all dependencies by running:


    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly lime pickle-mixin
